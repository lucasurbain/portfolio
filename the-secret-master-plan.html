            <p class="details-text "><strong>Background:</strong> My day job is actually resume by the fact that I’m a student in IT Science. I spend my days solving computer problems, imagining new technologies using algorithms or artificial intelligence, designing user designs to facilitate the user experience on different digital products and developing websites. I also help companies or individuals in the digital fields and help formulate an appropriate business and product strategy.
            </p>
            <p class="details-text ">
                Since the beginning, I have been dictated between my passions and my goals. In fact, it's a bit like following a pattern, or a road, that was already studied and established. I have been navigating for several years already between my passions for computer science, space or sport. But also between my dreams of building a future that resembles me and that lives up to my demands. That's why I naturally came up with the idea of a common thread, a Master Plan. I think this is due to my rigor and my discipline that is different from others. I have this square side of things to define and analyze things as best as possible in order to get the best result. This analysis allows me to set results objectives and guide myself in a clear direction. I will therefore describe to you point by point, the elements of my reflection, my opinion on certain topics and projects where I am actively developing.
            </p>
            <p class="details-title "><strong>Building a solid foundation :</strong>
            </p>   
            <p class="details-text ">
                As a solid foundation, I mean having a complete profile. My opinion is that diplomas are a good overall indicator of the person. I don't think it fully reflects their abilities, but rather reflects its personality. That's why in my case, I opted for a two-step course: a bachelor's degree in computer science + an MBA in computer science or digital. I think that with a Master's level, the credibility of my story and opinion is even stronger for novice people. In addition, being a very studious person and loving to learn new things, a Master Business is really something that I think looks like me. Especially, I think that abroad, a Master's level is recognized in most environments as a good source and a good level of skills in a field.
            </p>
            <p class="details-text
                ">
                From a professional point of view, I think it is important to have a good level of programming certainly, but especially in user strategy and user experience. For me, what makes a good product is a product where the developer has understood the user problem. It can be by making his life easier, changing his daily life or bringing him a new solution. That's why I train on my side in many user-oriented projects. Whether it's mini websites, mobile applications or artificial intelligence that make it possible to automate repetitive tasks. Experience and user feedback has always been a fundamental value for me. The user is the customer of the product. He must identify himself as well as possible in order to benefit from the best product. And I think this is the case in most projects, but they often tell me "ah but why did this site do that? Or "I think it's not really optimal, maybe it would have been better to do this". These are two examples among other times, whether negative or positive. I think this user issue should be addressed more widely
                by companies that underestimate it far too much in my opinion. </p>
                <p class="details-text">
                    One of the things that is often neglected by many people is personal well-being. I notice in my entourage that more and more people forget to think about their personal goals. That is why I would like to mention here two big personal goals that are close
                    to my heart. The first is to transform my body into an even more athletic body. I have always been skinny and very athletic since I was little. However, I think it is so much to make it evolve even more towards a more athletic and
                    efficient form. The second objective is an objective at the language level. At the time of writing this text, I speak three languages: French, English and German. I think that in the future, it would be important to speak three or
                    four languages. And when I say talk, it 's mostly to make yourself understood. I don't see the point of learning every word by heart, but rather bricks of words that are often used. In the future, I would like to improve my English
                    and especially my German to be even more effective.

                </p>
                <p class="details-title "><strong>Use this solid foundation to the next level : </strong>
                </p>
                <p class="details-text ">
                    As summarized above, I am therefore considering building a solid baggage over the next 5 years. I do not achieve these goals as personal satisfaction or as a goal to make my parents or friends proud. All this is thought out is thought out for the rest
                    of my journey, which will take place abroad. At the moment, I have been living in France since I was little. It's a fantastic country but it doesn't correspond to my culture. Since I was a child, I have always struggled to find my
                    bearings with French culture. In fact, I think it's just so different from mine, which poses a huge problem for me to understand and communicate with local people. In the end, it's as if I didn't feel like where I wanted to live, where
                    I wanted to be. And this feeling was accentuated when I discovered Switzerland.</p>
                <p class="details-text ">
                    Switzerland is a fantastic country. Between these mountains, incredible places and cultural diversity. This diversity is certainly the thing I prefer. It's as if you had the feeling of traveling to every person you meet and discuss. Since I was a child,
                    I have been used to crossing Switzerland and I always have the same smile and wonder when I'm there. It's as if at that very moment I became myself. It makes me feel calm, I think it's a bit like a good herbal tea with a good calming
                    effect power 1000. It is quite natural that I have been dreaming of being there permanently. In reality, I already think it was a lot of people who rated me and who were surprised to learn that I wanted to move there already when I
                    was barely 8 or 10 years old. It's really a dream that I keep deep inside myself, and that I would very much like to realize. I think this is one of my fundamental objectives. I don't know if I'm going to get there as I imagine in
                    my head, but I'll do everything I can to get there, that's for sure!</p>

                <p class="details-title "><strong>Use this to climb new high :</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="details-text ">
                    Climbing new heights means realizing other dreams that I keep in me. Like the number of Swiss mountain peaks, I have other projects that are very close to my heart. First, since 2013, I think, I have become very interested in a young automotive brand
                    in the field of tech. This brand is Tesla. I think that today I no longer need to present the brand in view of the success brought with the arrival of the Model 3. This brand fascinates me with its resemblance to Apple products. I
                    feel like I see like the iPhone of the car. Have a Tesla, and if possible an ultimate model like for me the model S and a real childhood dream !
                </p>
                <p class="details-text ">
                    I am also closely interested in another brand that reminds me of an iPhone: On. On are a company that designs and manufactures sports shoes. It is the brand in the sports environment with the highest growth, much like Tesla. On managed to create for me
                    a shoe that adapts to the environment in which it evolves with its cloud technology. With the recent arrival of Roger Federer in its shareholders with an investment of 55 million Swiss Francs, I think that the brand has real enormous
                    potential. Damn, if Roger invests so much it is because the product must be really good.
                </p>
                <p class="details-text ">
                    One last project I would like to mention is Starlink. Starlink is a constellation of low-orbit satellites allowing access to very high-speed internet with low latency. Thanks to its massive number of satellites, Starlink is able to cover the globe and
                    provide constant throughput. Starlink is for me a Game Changer, on the one hand by giving internet access anywhere in the world, and especially the day it is able to provide direct access to an iPhone. This would simply mean the end
                    of the white areas. White areas are really problematic. Having the habit of hiking in the forest, it is often usual to no longer have a network in these areas, which can often be dangerous. In case of injury, you simply can't contact
                    anyone. This is therefore important for safety, to be able to communicate in case of need or serious problem. I really hope that the project will go in this direction one day, because it could come to the biggest revolution in the
                    world of Internet communications.
                </p>

                <p class="details-title "><strong>Other Things :</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="details-text ">
                    One of my last passions is of course exploration. Traveling is like a new opening of mind every trip. Between the smells you smell, the sounds you hear or the people you meet. Every trip is different, it's like a new story every time. Since I was a child,
                    I have been used to traveling. So I would always like to continue in this direction by discovering even more places as crazy and beautiful as each other. Recently I was lucky to be able to go to the Maldives twice, it's really a wonderful
                    place. I really love being on an island serving the middle of the ocean. I really have to be one of the only ones who likes to be on a large service, to be able to think about my next projects or objectives. I've always hated the crowd
                    and the beach dessert combo is really perfect. Traveling is for me a goal that everyone should have. It opens the mind easily and it would be great to have people cruelly open.

                <p class="details-text-short">
                    - Study and have a Master's level in order to have a solid background

                <p class="details-text-short">- Use this solid baggage by moving to Switzerland afterwards
